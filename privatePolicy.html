                        details or Personal Data with us unless you have their permission or consent to do so.

                    <p class="content">
                        5. While labelling blockchain wallet addresses is an integral part of our business, we do not
                        use Personal Data of our users (such as the blockchain wallet addresses in their account or
                        profile information) to add or publish such labels or otherwise reveal the identity of any
                        natural person as the owner of any given blockchain wallet address.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        6. In addition, we do not take any other steps that would reveal the identity of any natural
                        person as the owner of any given blockchain wallet address or otherwise make them identifiable
                        (taking account of the means reasonably likely to be used to identify them). Indeed, at ZarkLab,
                        we do not have the technical ability to effect any such identification of owners of blockchain
                        wallet addresses ourselves – we have also adopted and implemented technical and organisational
                        measures to further cement the fact that no such identification should occur in the ordinary
                        course of our business. There may be limited exceptions to this general rule, for example, we
                        may add labels about a high-profile public figure who has publicly declared their blockchain
                        wallet address; however, such circumstances cover a statistically insignificant percentage of
                        the blockchain wallet address-related information we use to provide our websites and services.
